        <p id="recipe_description">It's an common food that it's easily made using only
            2 pieces of bread and the content that is going between both parts of the bread,
            a cheese sandwich includes any type of cheese.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 slices of bread</li>
            <li>Any type of cheese</li>
            <li>Any type of meat</li>
            <li>Mayonnaise</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To prepare a normal sandwich, add mayonnaise on side of both slices of bread
                then add the meat and cheese of your choice.
            </li>
            <li>Put the sandwich on a frying pan without oil and proceed to press the sandwich
                firmly against the pan multiple times and flip the sandwich one side to the other
                until you have both sides fried and the cheese on the middle is melted enough so it
                can act like a glue so that's when you know you have a Grilled Cheese Sandwich.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>NOTE: You can add anything between the slices but only if it doesn't destroy
            or makes the bread slices too soft.
