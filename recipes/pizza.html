                <ol>
                    <li>To prepare the Pizza dough, add the all purpose flour and start mixing it up 
                        with salt and baking powder then make sure to spread everything out well 
                        around the center and corners. Add the some warm water, yeast plus the teaspoon 
                        of sugar and vegetal oil in the mixture. Keep mixing up the dough for 10 to 15 
                        minutes. When the yeast rises add the flour knead the dough nicely using water
                        and keep this dough aside for 4 to 6 hours. Then knead the dough once again and the
                        pizza dough is ready.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Preheat the oven at 180 degree Celsius, make the pizza base with the dough made previously.
                        Dust the space with little dry flour and grab a large amount of the pizza dough and using a
                        rolling pin, roll this dough into a nice circular base, once the base it's made use a fork
                        and prick and put the pizza base in the preheated oven and bake it for 10 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>Now slice your vegetables and meat so we can prepare them for the pizza, once the pizza base is
                        baked add some tomato sauce and spread it around and add all the vegetables and meat you want with
                        a large amount of cheese of your choice and then we put the pizza on the oven once again but make sure
